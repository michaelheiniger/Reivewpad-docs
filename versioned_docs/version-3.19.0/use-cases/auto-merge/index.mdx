The ability to configure automatic pull request merge can greatly unblock developers that typically wait for hours, or even days, to receive a LGTM review.

Since not every pull request needs the same review process, using the semantic features of Reviewpad, you can configure many scenarios where auto-merge seems natural.

Out of the box, Reviewpad supports a [merge action](/guides/built-ins#merge) which can be used in multiple scenarios.

## Auto-merge based on file properties

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example1}</CodeBlock>

## Auto-merge small pull requests

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example2}</CodeBlock>

## Auto-merge non-critical pull requests

The [**hasAnnotation**](/guides/built-ins#hasannotation) built-in can be used to configure powerful auto-merges. See a more in-depth example of the usage of [**hasAnnotation**](/guides/built-ins#hasannotation) in the [automated labelling section](/use-cases/label-critical-changes-with-semantic-code-annotations).

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example3}</CodeBlock>

## Auto-merge on required approvals

In GitHub, repository administrators can require a minimum number of pull request approvals before merging into a protected branch.

However, we may want the required number of approvals to come from a defined set of users/team. In this case, GitHub does not offer this ability.

We can use Reviewpad to verify if a pull request has the required number of approvals from a specific team.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration that verifies if a pull request has at least 2 approvals from the core team when changes are critical.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example4}</CodeBlock>
