The [hasCodePattern](/guides/built-ins#hascodepattern) built-in allows us to query the code contained in the diff.

This ability let us a query for changes and understand, for instance, if sensitive (e.g. access token) data was explicitly added to the code.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
