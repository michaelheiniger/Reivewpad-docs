[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.

Reviewpad can be used to check and provide an error message if a commit in a pull request does not comply with the conventional commits specification.

Here's an example of a `reviewpad.yml` configuration file that checks the pull request's commits whenever the action runs.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
