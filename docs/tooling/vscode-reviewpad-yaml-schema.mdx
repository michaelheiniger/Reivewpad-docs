To minimize errors when editing Reviewpad files, you can setup the `reviewpad.yml` schema on VSCode.

You just need to download the latest JSON schema from [schemas/reviewpad](https://github.com/reviewpad/schemas/tree/main) and add the following settings to your VSCode workspace:

```json
{
    // Associate Reviewpad schema to reviewpad.(yml|yaml) files
    "yaml.schemas": {
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reviewpad/schemas/main/latest/schema.json": [
            "reviewpad.yml",
            "reviewpad.yaml",
        ]
    },
}
```

Now, when you are editing you will be able to check if your Reviewpad file is syntactically correct, access the documentation and get auto-completion of certain fields.
