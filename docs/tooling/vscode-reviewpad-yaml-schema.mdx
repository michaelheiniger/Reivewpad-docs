To minimise errors when editing Reviewpad files, you can setup the Reviewpad yml schema on VSCode. 

You just need to download the latest JSON schema from [schemas/reviewpad](https://github.com/reviewpad/schemas/tree/main) and add the following settings to your VSCode workspace:

```json
"settings": {
	"yaml.schemas": {
		"PATH/schema.json": [
			"reviewpad.yml",
		]
	}
}
```

Now, when you are editing you will be able to check if your Reviewpad file is syntactically correct, access the documentation and get auto-completion of certain fields.
