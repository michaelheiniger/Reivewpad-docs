The size of a pull request is a good indicator of how much work is involved in reviewing it.

To help reviewers gauge the size of a pull request, you can add a label to it.

This is especially useful when the list of pull requests is big and you want to quickly see which one better fits your schedule.

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
