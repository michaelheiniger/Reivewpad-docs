This built-in is unavailable for issues. Reviewpad will ignore it when running on issues.

:::

**Description**:

The `changed` built-in receives two regexes with named capturing groups denoted by the `@X` pattern.

These regexes are matched against the set of files in the patch.

The built-in checks if the value set of the first regex is contained in the second one.

**Parameters**:

| Parameter           | Type   | Description                             |
| :------------------ | :----- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `pre_file_pattern`  | string | The antecedent file pattern expression. |
| `post_file_pattern` | string | The consequent file pattern expression. |

**Return value**:

| Type       | Description                                                                                    |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean`  | `true` if the value set of the first regex is contained in the second one, `false` otherwise.  |

**Examples**:

```yml
$changed("@1.go", "@1.md")
```

This spec will return `true` if for each file in the patch with the extension `.go`
there is also a file in the patch with the same name with the extension `.md`.

A `reviewpad.yml` example:

<CodeBlock language="yml" title="reviewpad.yml">{Example}</CodeBlock>
