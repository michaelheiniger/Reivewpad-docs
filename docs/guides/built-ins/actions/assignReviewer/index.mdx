This built-in is unavailable for issues. Reviewpad will ignore it when running on issues.

**Description**:

Assigns a defined amount of reviewers to the pull request from the provided list of reviewers.

Reviewers can be assigned following one of the described policies:
- `random`: the reviewers are chosen in a random manner;
- `round-robin`: the reviewers are chosen following the `round-robin` algorithm;
- `reviewpad`: the reviewers are chosen based on the total number of pull requests assigned to them. The smaller the number of pull requests assigned to a reviewer, the greater the probability of being picked.

When there are not enough reviewers to assign to, a warning is returned.

If a reviewer from the defined list has performed a review, their review will be re-requested.
