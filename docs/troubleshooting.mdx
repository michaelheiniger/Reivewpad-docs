## Syntax errors

When there is a syntax error in your configuration, Reviewpad will show an error message:

```yml
`Parse error: failed to build AST`
```

This error means that Reviewpad wasn't able to parse a property `spec` defined in the configuration.

Some of the common parsing errors are:

### Using `'` instead of `"` for strings {#single-quotes}

| Bad                  | Good                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `$addLabel('hello')` |  `$addLabel("hello")` |

### Missing the `$` prefix when using a built-in {#missing-dollar-prefix}

| Bad                        | Good                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `hasFileName("README.md")` | `$hasFileName("README.md")` |

### Missing the parenthesis `()` when using a built-in {#missing-parenthesis}

| Bad         | Good           |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| `$isMerged` | `$isMerged()`  |

### Using `seconds` on [relative timestamps](./use-cases/timestamps/#relative-timestamps) {#seconds-on-relative-timestamps}

For now, Reviewpad only supports minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years on relative timestamps. Using seconds will result in an error.

| Bad                  | Good            |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| `60 seconds ago`     | `1 minute ago`  |

Here's an example of the error:

```yml
workflows:
  - name: maybe-LGTM
    if:
    # This will fail because we are using seconds
    - rule: $totalCodeReviews() > 1 && $createdAt() < 60 seconds ago
    then:
    - $comment("This PR got a fast review. Is it a LGTM?")
```

## Built-ins misuse

### Using GitHub suite name instead of check run name {#use-check-run-name}

When using the built-ins:
- [`$checkRunConclusion`](./guides/built-ins/#checkrunconclusion)
- [`$hasAnyCheckRunCompleted`](./guides/built-ins/#hasanycheckruncompleted)
- [`$haveAllChecksRunCompleted`](./guides/built-ins/#haveallchecksruncompleted)
- [`$workflowStatus` 🗑️](./guides/built-ins/#workflowstatus)

We need to use the **check run name** instead of the suite name.

In the following GitHub workflow example, the suite name is `CI` and the check run name is `build`:

```yml
name: CI # check suite name

on:
  push:

jobs:
  build: # check run name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!
```

Following the example above, we would use `build` instead of `CI`:

```bash
$checkRunConclusion("build")
$hasAnyCheckRunCompleted(["build"])
$haveAllChecksRunCompleted(["build"])
$workflowStatus("build")
```
